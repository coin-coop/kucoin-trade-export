# KuCoin CSV Exporter
Java application to export trades from KuCoin to a CSV file readable by CoinTracking.info. Code uses my own unofficial KuCoin Java API: https://github.com/coin-coop/kucoin-api. In future it will include withdrawals and deposits.

Use program on your own risk.

## Run

1. Run exe file
2. Insert your API and Secret Key (if you copy-paste - use Ctrl+V /Strg+V to paste it)
3. Choose location and name of the file for download
4. Press Download CSV and wait until all transactions are saved to file
